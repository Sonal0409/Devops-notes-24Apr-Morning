1. Become root user:

# sudo su -

2. Install git if on AWS ec2 instance

# yum install git -y

Above command not required on edureka Lab.

3. Create a Local repository using GIT

#  mkdir myproject

# cd myproject

# touch index1.html index2.html

# ls

# git init

A local repository will be created

# ls -al

.git folder will be available, which is your local repository.


4. Add the configuration parameters in git, which will later update author and email details in the git commit history

2 variables need to be set

user.name
user.email


# git config --global user.name sonal0409

# git config --global user.email admin@gmail.com

List the configurations:

git config --list

try it latter
==========================
git config --global --unset user.name

git config --global --unset user.email



5. Add the files to the stagging area and commit them to Local repo
=========================================

# git status

# git add <filename> <filename2>

or

git add --all

or

git add .

or

git add *.java *.php

# git status

# git commit -m "adding file index1.html"

Commit all the changes/files in the stagging area

If we want to Choose a file to be commited

git commit -m "adding file index1.html" <filename>

================================================

6. Modify exisitng files and add those changes to local repo
====================================================

Take a file which is in local repo

# git ls-files

# vim index1.html

add any data & save the file

# git status

status of file is modified

To add all the modification and commit them to local repo

# git commit -a -m "added modifications"


7. If some files are not required to be tracked by GIT --> ignore certain files for version control

=================================================

Git provides the concept of gitignore, where in we create a file with the name .gitignore
And we will add names of the files that we dont want to track
This concept is applicable to files which are new and untracked

# vim .gitignore

In this file insert the name of files to be ingores

press i

*.txt
*.php
*.state

:wq

# git status

This concept this applicable to new file(files that are not commited)
It is only for untracked file.


8. How can GIT can ignore changes on tracked files for certian time.

GIT STASHING

============================================

If we have some incomplete work on tracked files, we can stash them in a temporary location and latter we can get them back to working directory

vim index1.html

press i

inster some new data

press esc key
:wq   and then enter key

# git status ==> you will see modiffied file

# git diff index1.html

Stash the modifications

# git stash

you can see the stash in .git==>refs==>stash folder

# git stash list

stash is saved a n array of index

stash name stash@{0}

see what saved in the stash 

# git show stash@{0}
git stash pop: This command is used to apply and remove the most recent stash.It's equivalent to running git stash apply followed by git stash drop.

git stash drop: This command is used to discard a specific stash. You need to provide the stash reference as an argument
git stash drop stash@{2}




================================================

19-Apr Notes
================================================

# sudo su -

# cd myproject

1. Check the log for commit history

# git log

in this HEAD it is an object in git which represents the latest/recent commit id

# git log --oneline

Check commit history of every commit in a single line

# git show <commid id>
Shows what happened in that commit.

See commits of a particular file:

 git log --graph --all -- index1.html


2. Create a feature branch in git  and switch to the branch

========================================

# git branch

Create a new branch

# git branch feature1

Switch to the new branch

# git checkout feature1

[OR]

Create a new branch and switch to the branch also

# git checkout -b feature2

3. Merge the commits/files of new branch to master

Before merging always switch to the destination branch

# git checkout master

# git merge feature1 master

< git merge sourcebranch destinationbranch>


4. Delete a branch which is not merged with master branch

# git branch -D <branchname>

Delete a branch whose commits have been merged with the master branch

# git branch -d feature1


5. Reset the commit history

# git reset --hard <commitid>

here:

commit id is where the HEAD will point to now.

All the other commits above it will be deleted and the chnages will also be deleted from LR and working directory.

It is a destructive command


6. Rebase merging strategy in GIT (rewind the commit history)

# git branch

you should be on the master branch

Now create a new branch

# git branch feature1

On the master branch create 2  new commits

example of my log on master branch

8bce083 (HEAD -> master) on master branch 2
daa1204 on master branch1
ea61e8e (feature1) added modifications
0a733ed adding file index1.html


Now switch to feature branch and create 2 new commits


example of my log on master branch

9981946 (HEAD -> feature1) on branch
156dc12 done in feature branch
ea61e8e added modifications
0a733ed adding file index1.html


I want to rebase - re organise the base of my feature branch

Make sure you are on feature branch

# git rebase master


The commit history will be as such:

41f5d79 (HEAD -> feature1) on branch
9469e15 done in feature branch
8bce083 (master) on master branch 2
daa1204 on master branch1
ea61e8e added modifications
0a733ed adding file index1.html

GITHUB:

==================================================

Login to github.com

============================


Personal access tokens (classic) function like ordinary OAuth access tokens. They can be used instead of a password for Git over HTTPS, or can be used to authenticate to the API over Basic Authentication.

1. Create a personal access token:

 > clcik on user menu which is on the extreme right
 > click on settings in that
 > scroll down, on left side you will see developer settings -- click on it
 > on left side 3 rd option --> personla Access token
 > select tokens(classic)
 > click on generate new token --> click on generate new token classic
 > in note --give token name as token19
 > expiration --> leave as is
 > select scopes --> clcik on repo checkbox
 > scroll down and clcik on generate token
 > the generated token need to be copied safely

Make sure to copy your personal access token now. You wonâ€™t be able to see it again!

token:

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


2. Create a remote repository

3. Connect local repo to remote repo

# git checkout master

# git remote add origin https://github.com/Sonal0409/myproject19Apr.git

# git remote -v 

Remove origin if needed

# git remote rm origin


Push data from local to remote

# git push origin master

username : github
password: token

================================

Create a file in github on master branch and pull the file to merge in local repoisotry master branch


Once file is create don master branch of remote repo

go to local repo

# git checkout master

# git pull origin master

pull will fecth changes and merge them with LR and WD

================================


Clone a remote repository to local machine

# git clone https://github.com/Sonal0409/myproject19Apr.git


Forking - complete
===========================================
